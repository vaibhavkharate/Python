# """ some Theory about python

# - Python Virtual Machine (PVM): The PVM is the runtime engine of Python that executes the bytecode. It is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing it on the host machine.
# - Python Interpreter: The Python interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code. It can be run in interactive mode or script mode.
# - code loop to iterate byte code: The Python interpreter reads the bytecode and executes it line by line. It uses a loop to iterate through the bytecode instructions and execute them one by one.
# - run time engine: The runtime engine is responsible for executing the Python code. It manages memory allocation, garbage collection, and other runtime tasks.


# byte code is not machine Code
# python specific interpretation
# cpython, jython, pypy, ironpython
